[Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)<br/><br/>

You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money.<br/>

Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.<br/>

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.<br/>

 

### Example 1:

**Input**: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11<br/>
**Output**: 3<br/>
**Explanation**: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1<br/>

### Example 2:

**Input**: coins = [2], amount = 3<br/>
**Output**: -1<br/>

### Example 3:

**Input**: coins = [1], amount = 0<br/>
**Output**: 0<br/>
