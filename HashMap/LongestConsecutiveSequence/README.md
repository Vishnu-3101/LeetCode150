[Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)<br/><br/>

Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.<br/>

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.<br/>

 

### Example 1:

**Input:** nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]<br/>
**Output:** 4<br/>
**Explanation:** The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.<br/>

### Example 2:

**Input:** nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]<br/>
**Output:** 9<br/>
