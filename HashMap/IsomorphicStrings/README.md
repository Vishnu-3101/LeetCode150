Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.<br/>

Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.<br/>

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.<br/>

 

### Example 1:

**Input:** s = "egg", t = "add"<br/>
**Output:** true<br/>
