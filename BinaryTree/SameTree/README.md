Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.<br/>

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.<br/>



### Example 1:


**Input:** p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]<br/>
**Output:** true<br/>
