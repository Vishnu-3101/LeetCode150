[Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)<br/><br/>

Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return true if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals targetSum.<br/>

A leaf is a node with no children.<br/>

 
### Example 1:


**Input:** root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,null,1], targetSum = 22<br/>
**Output:** true<br/>
**Explanation:** The root-to-leaf path with the target sum is shown.<br/>
