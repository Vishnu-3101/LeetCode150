[Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/average-of-levels-in-binary-tree/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)<br/><br/>

Given the root of a binary tree, return the average value of the nodes on each level in the form of an array. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.<br/>
 

### Example 1:


**Input:** root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]<br/>
**Output:** [3.00000,14.50000,11.00000]<br/>
**Explanation:** The average value of nodes on level 0 is 3, on level 1 is 14.5, and on level 2 is 11.<br/>
Hence return [3, 14.5, 11].<br/>
