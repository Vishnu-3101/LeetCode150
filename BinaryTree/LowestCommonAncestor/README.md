[Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)<br/><br/>

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.<br/>

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”<br/>

 

### Example 1:


**Input:** root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1<br/>
**Output:** 3<br/>
**Explanation:** The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.<br/>
