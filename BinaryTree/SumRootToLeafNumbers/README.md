[Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-root-to-leaf-numbers/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)<br/><br/>

You are given the root of a binary tree containing digits from 0 to 9 only.<br/>

Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.<br/>

For example, the root-to-leaf path 1 -> 2 -> 3 represents the number 123.<br/>
Return the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers. Test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.<br/>

A leaf node is a node with no children.<br/>

 
### Example 1:


**Input:** root = [1,2,3]<br/>
**Output:** 25<br/>
**Explanation:** <br/>
The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.<br/>
The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.<br/>
Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = 25.<br/>
