[Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-binary-tree-to-linked-list/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)<br/><br/>

Given the root of a binary tree, flatten the tree into a "linked list":<br/>

The "linked list" should use the same TreeNode class where the right child pointer points to the next node in the list and the left child pointer is always null.<br/>
The "linked list" should be in the same order as a pre-order traversal of the binary tree.<br/>
 

### Example 1:


**Input:** root = [1,2,5,3,4,null,6]<br/>
**Output:** [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]<br/>
