[Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)<br/><br/>

A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.<br/>

The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.<br/>

Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.<br/>

 

### Example 1:


**Input:** root = [1,2,3]<br/>
**Output:** 6<br/>
**Explanation:** The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.<br/>


### Example 2:

**Input:** root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]<br/>
**Output:** 42<br/>
**Explanation:** The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42.<br/>
