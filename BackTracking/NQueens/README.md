[Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-queens/description/)<br/><br/>

The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.<br/>

Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle. You may return the answer in any order.<br/>

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space, respectively.<br/>

### Example 1:

**Input:** n = 4<br/>
**Output:** [[".Q..","...Q","Q...","..Q."],["..Q.","Q...","...Q",".Q.."]]<br/>
**Explanation:** There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown above<br/>
