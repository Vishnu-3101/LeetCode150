[Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)<br/><br/>

Given an array of distinct integers candidates and a target integer target, return a list of all unique combinations of candidates where the chosen numbers sum to target. You may return the combinations in any order.<br/>

The same number may be chosen from candidates an unlimited number of times. Two combinations are unique if the 
frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.<br/>

The test cases are generated such that the number of unique combinations that sum up to target is less than 150 combinations for the given input.<br/>

 

### Example 1:

**Input:** candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7<br/>
**Output:** [[2,2,3],[7]]<br/>
**Explanation:**<br/>
2 and 3 are candidates, and 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. Note that 2 can be used multiple times.<br/>
7 is a candidate, and 7 = 7.<br/>
These are the only two combinations.<br/>
