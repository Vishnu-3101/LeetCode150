Given an integer array nums of length n and an integer target, find three integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target.<br/>

Return the sum of the three integers.<br/>

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.<br/>

 

### Example 1:

**Input:** nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1<br/>
**Output:** 2<br/>
**Explanation:** The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).<br/>
