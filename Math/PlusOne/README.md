[Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/plus-one/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)<br><br/>

You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.<br/>

Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.<br/>

 

### Example 1:

**Input**: digits = [1,2,3]<br/>
**Output**: [1,2,4]<br/>
**Explanation**: The array represents the integer 123.<br/>
Incrementing by one gives 123 + 1 = 124.<br/>
Thus, the result should be [1,2,4].<br/>
