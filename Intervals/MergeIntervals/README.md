[Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)<br/><br/>

Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.<br/>

 

### Example 1:

**Input:** intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]<br/>
**Output:** [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]<br/>
**Explanation:** Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].<br/>

### Example 2:

**Input:** intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]<br/>
**Output:** [[1,5]]<br/>
**Explanation:** Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.<br/>
