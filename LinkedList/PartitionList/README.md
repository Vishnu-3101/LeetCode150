[Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-list/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)<br/><br/>

Given the head of a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.<br/>

You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.<br/>

 

### Example 1:


**Input:** head = [1,4,3,2,5,2], x = 3<br/>
**Output:** [1,2,2,4,3,5]<br/>
