[Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)<br/><br/>

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.<br/>

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.<br/>

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.<br/>

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.<br/>


### Example 1:

**Input**: nums = [1,2,3,1]<br/>
**Output**: 2<br/>
**Explanation**: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.<br/>

### Example 2:

**Input**: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]<br/>
**Output**: 5<br/>
**Explanation**: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.<br/>
