[Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)<br/><br/>

Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).<br/>

A valid BST is defined as follows:<br/>

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.<br/>
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.<br/>
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.<br/>
 

### Example 1:


**Input:** root = [2,1,3]<br/>
**Output:** true<br/>
