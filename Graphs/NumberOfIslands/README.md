[Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)<br/><br/>

Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.<br/>

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.<br/>

 

### Example 1:

**Input:** grid = [<br/>
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],<br/>
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],<br/>
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],<br/>
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]<br/>
]<br/>
**Output:** 1<br/>
### Example 2:

**Input:** grid = [<br/>
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],<br/>
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],<br/>
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],<br/>
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]<br/>
]<br/>
**Output:** 3<br/>
