[Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)<br/><br/>

Write a function that takes the binary representation of a positive integer and returns the number of 
set bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).<br/>

 

### Example 1:

**Input**: n = 11<br/>

**Output**: 3<br/>

**Explanation**:<br/>

The input binary string 1011 has a total of three set bits.

### Example 2:

**Input**: n = 128<br/>

**Output**: 1<br/>

**Explanation**:<br/>

The input binary string 10000000 has a total of one set bit.<br/>
