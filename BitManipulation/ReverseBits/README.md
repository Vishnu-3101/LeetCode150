[Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-bits/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)<br/><br/>

Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.<br/>

**Note**:<br/>

Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, both input and output will be given as a signed integer type. They should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.<br/>
In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. Therefore, in Example 2 above, the input represents the signed integer -3 and the output represents the signed integer -1073741825.<br/>
 

### Example 1:

**Input**: n = 00000010100101000001111010011100<br/>
**Output**:    964176192 (00111001011110000010100101000000)<br/>
**Explanation**: The input binary string 00000010100101000001111010011100 represents the unsigned integer 43261596, so return 964176192 which its binary representation is 00111001011110000010100101000000.<br/>
