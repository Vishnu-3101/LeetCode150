[Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-ii/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)<br/><br/>

Given an integer array nums where every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find the single element and return it.<br/>

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.<br/>

### Example 1:

**Input**: nums = [2,2,3,2]<br/>
**Output**: 3<br/>

### Example 2:

**Input**: nums = [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]<br/>
**Output**: 99<br/>
